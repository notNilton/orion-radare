# RADAR - Reconciliação e Análise de Dados em Ambiente Responsivo

Recyon is an advanced web-based application built using TypeScript, React.js, and ReactFlow. This dashboard allows users to create detailed models of plant sensors, input measurement data, and perform data reconciliation to identify and analyze anomalies.

## Features

- **Interactive Plant Modeling**: Easily create and visualize models of your plant's sensors using a user-friendly interface.
- **Data Input**: Introduce and manage sensor measurements directly within the application.
- **Data Reconciliation**: Reconcile the input data to detect inconsistencies and anomalies, ensuring data integrity.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Identify potential issues with sensor data, helping you maintain optimal plant operations.

## Technologies Used

- **React.js**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **TypeScript**: A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript, enhancing code quality and maintainability.
- **ReactFlow**: A library for building node-based editors and diagrams, providing the interactive modeling capabilities.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your development machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 12 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (version 6 or higher) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/notNilton/recyon.git
   cd recyon
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or

To start the development server, run:

```bash
npm start
# or
yarn start
```

Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to view the application.

## Usage

1. **Create Sensor Models**: Use the intuitive drag-and-drop interface to design your plant's sensor layout.
2. **Input Measurements**: Enter sensor data directly into the model.
3. **Reconcile Data**: Run the reconciliation process to detect and highlight any anomalies or inconsistencies in the data.
4. **Analyze Results**: Review the results to understand and address potential issues with sensor data.
